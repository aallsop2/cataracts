## Introduction
  
- Research Questions:   
    + Are mice in some families more likely to develop more severe cataracts?
- Experimental Design:  
    + 1820 genetically heterogeneous mice from 48 unique families were randomly assigned, with equal family weights, to three treatment groups: Gamma radiation, HZE radiation, and unirradiated control. The simplified dataset records symptoms at time of death for mice of Age $\ge$ 552 days, for a total sample size of 1169.   
    + **Response**: Cataracts Status, either 0 or 1. Where 1 indicates the presence of cataracts that are of clinical concern.  
    + **Primary predictors under consideration**: Treatment, Family  
    + **Covariates**: Sex, Weight, Coat Color, Body Condition Score, Age, Myeloid Leukemia, Harderian Tumor, PreT Lymphoma

## Conclusions
- Our frequentist model shows the difference in cataract development among treatment groups is much larger among male rats
- Overall, the HZE group had the highest development of cataracts, followed by the Gamma group and then the unirradiated rats.
- Limitations?
