## Background
  
- Intro  
- Experimental Design  
- Methods Overview

## Summary Tables & Plots

Do we want to put code in the presentation, or just save outputs from report as .png and load them? I think the second option would be preferable

## Mixed Logistic Regression

- Write out final model in math notation  
- Provide table/graph of relevant outputs  

## Bayesian Mixed Logistic Regression

- Write out final model in math notation - priors, likelihood
- Provide table/graph of relevant outputs
  
  
## Results & Conclusions  

- What can we infer about fixed and random effects from the models?
- Limitations?  
- What questions does this raise for future studies?
