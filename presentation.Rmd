## Background
  
- Intro  
- Experimental Design  
- Methods Overview

## Summary Tables & Plots

Do we want to put code in the presentation, or just save outputs from report as .png and load them? I think the second option would be preferable

## Mixed Logistic Regression

The final model can be written as:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = &\beta_0*Control*F\ +\beta_1*Gamma*F\ + \beta_2*HZE*F\ + \\ &\beta_3*Control*M\ +\beta_4*Gamma*M\ + \beta_5*HZE*M\ + \\
&u + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
\]


## Bayesian Mixed Logistic Regression

- Write out final model in math notation - priors, likelihood
- Provide table/graph of relevant outputs
  
  
## Results & Conclusions  

- What can we infer about fixed and random effects from the models?
- Limitations?  
- What questions does this raise for future studies?
