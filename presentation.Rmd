## Introduction
  
- Research Questions:   
    + Are mice in some families more likely to develop more severe cataracts?
- Experimental Design:  
    + 1820 genetically heterogeneous mice from 48 unique families were randomly assigned, with equal family weights, to three treatment groups: Gamma radiation, HZE radiation, and unirradiated control. The simplified dataset records symptoms at time of death for mice of Age $\ge$ 552 days, for a total sample size of 1169.   
    + **Response**: Cataracts Status, either 0 or 1. Where 1 indicates the presence of cataracts that are of clinical concern.  
    + **Primary predictors under consideration**: Treatment, Family  
    + **Covariates**: Sex, Weight, Coat Color, Body Condition Score, Age, Myeloid Leukemia, Harderian Tumor, PreT Lymphoma

## Mixed Logistic Regression

# mixed model binomial logistic regression using adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature (nAGQ = 25)
mix_mod_full <- glmer(Cataracts ~ Sex + Weight + CoatColor + BCS + HarderianTumor + 
                        MyeloidLeukemia + PreTLymphoma + Treatment + (1|Family), nAGQ = 25, 
                      data = cats, family = binomial)

                        MyeloidLeukemia + PreTLymphoma + Treatment, data = cats, family = binomial)
fixed_mod <- glm(Cataracts ~ Treatment*Sex, data = cats, family = binomial)


# test full vs reduced mixed models
anova(mix_mod_full, mixed_mod)

summary(mix_mod_full)
summary(mixed_mod)
summary(fixed_mod)
```

```{r}
#table of AIC values


aics <- c(AIC(mix_mod_full), AIC(mixed_mod), AIC(fixed_mod))
bics <- c(BIC(mix_mod_full), BIC(mixed_mod), BIC(fixed_mod))
dt <- rbind(aics, bics)
colnames(dt) <- c("Full Mixed Model", "Reduced Mixed Model", "Fixed Effects Model")
rownames(dt) <- c("AIC", "BIC")

```
* Model Selection
  + Full model including all predictors and covariates plus a random intercept for family
  + Reduced model only including: sex, treatment group, and a random intercept for family
  + Fixed effects model including only sex and treatment group
* Final model includes:
  + Sex, Treatment, and Random Intercept for Family
  
## Mixed Logistic Regression
* The final model can be written as:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
Y \sim\ &Binomial(1169, p)\ \ \mbox{or parameterized as   }\  Y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p) \\
log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = &\ \beta_0*Unirradiated_i*F_i\ +\beta_1*Gamma_i*F_i\ + \beta_2*HZE_i*F_i\ + \\ &\beta_3*Unirradiated_i*M_i\ +\beta_4*Gamma_i*M_i\ + \beta_5*HZE_i*M_i\ + \\
[&v_{j} + \epsilon_{ij}] \\
&i = 1, ..., 1169\ \mbox{ mice} \\
&j = 1,...,47\ \ \mbox{ families}
\end{aligned}
\]  



## Bayesian Mixed Logistic Regression
<div class='"columns-2">

The final Bayesian model can be written as:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
Y \sim Binomial&(1169, p) \ \mbox{   or parameterized as   }\ \ \  Y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p)\\
log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = &\ \beta_0*Control_i*F_i\ +\beta_1*Gamma_i*F_i\ + \beta_2*HZE_i*F_i\ + \\ &\beta_3*Control_i*M_i\ +\beta_4*Gamma*M\ + \beta_5*HZE*M\ + \\
&v_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}\\
&i = 1, ..., 1169\ \mbox{ mice} \\
&j = 1,...,47\ \ \mbox{ families, and} \\
v_j \sim N(0, \tau)
\end{aligned}
\]  


With non-informative parameters:  
\[
\begin{aligned}
\beta_0 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_1 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_2 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_3 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_4 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_5 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\tau &\sim Gamma(0.001, 0.001) \mbox{ where}\ \sigma^2 = 1/\tau\\
\end{aligned}
\]

## Results & Conclusions {.smaller}  

- Our frequentist model shows the difference in cataract development among treatment groups is much larger among male rats
- Overall, the HZE group had the highest development of cataracts, followed by the Gamma group and then the unirradiated rats.

```{r, include = FALSE}
cats_emms <- emmeans(mixed_mod, ~ Treatment | Sex, infer = TRUE, type = "response")
pairs(cats_emms, reverse = TRUE)
```

```{r}
emmip(cats_emms, Treatment ~ Sex) + theme_light() + ggtitle("Predicted Probabilities of Cataracts \nby Sex and Treatment Group") + scale_color_startrek() + ylab("Predicted Probabilities")
```
- Limitations?  
- What questions does this raise for future studies?
