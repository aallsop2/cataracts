??? 
Thanks for joining and listening to us talk about cataracts in mice! We are discussing our analysis  of Dr Weil's and Dr. Edmondson's research into the effects of high atomic energy (HZE) radiation. This work is important because there is very little precedent into studying this topic, and it has direct applications to space travel beyond the protection from HZE ions inside Earth's magnetic field.

## Introduction
  
- Research Questions:  
    + Are mice in some families more likely to develop more severe cataracts?
    + Accounting for family clustering, are there differences in cataract development between treatment groups?  
  
???
This particular analysis focuses on potential genetic susceptibilty to developing cataracts. The mice used in this experiment were bred to be biologically heterogeneous, so any genetic predispositions may be easier to assess. Accounting for genetic effects also allows better examination of the effects of treatment on the outcome.  
--
- Variable Definitions:  
    + **Response**: Cataracts Status, either 0 or 1. Where 1 indicates the presence of cataracts that are of clinical concern.  
    + **Primary Predictors**: Treatment, Family  
    + **Possible Covariates**: Sex, Weight, Coat Color, Body Condition Score, Age, Myeloid Leukemia, Harderian Tumor, PreT Lymphoma  
  
???
The outcome in question is a binary response variable indicating presence or absence of cataracts. The treatment consists of three groups: Gamma irradiation, HZE irradiation, and Unirradiated Control. Biological Family indicates the random genetic effect. The dataset also contained information on potentially important covariates. 
--
- Experimental Design:  
    + 1820 genetically heterogeneous mice from 48 unique families were randomly assigned, with equal family weights, to the three treatment groups. 
    + Mice in the active treatment groups were irradiated at 7-12 weeks of age; all mice were monitored weekly for various symptoms. 
    + The simplified dataset in this analysis records symptoms at time of death for mice of Age $\ge$ 552 days, for a total sample size of 1169.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
???
The experimental design led us to conclude that we would include both Treatment and Family in a final model; consequently, our exploratory data analysis focused on associations between these variables and the response, other covariates and the response, and potential correlations and interactions between the main predictors, covariates, and the response. The barplot on the left shows sample proportions with cataracts for groups split by Treatment and Sex. The differences between sexes indicated to us that this covariate may be of interest in our final model. We also performed an exploratory assessment of the random effect of family; the line plot shows averaged binary Cataract score for each family across sex and treatment group. This visualizes the different behaviors in different families, but presence of clustering is not obvious.

## Final Model
$Y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p)$  

$$\begin{aligned}
log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = &\ \beta_0\ +\beta_1*Gamma_i\ + \beta_2*HZE_i\ + \beta_3*Control_i*M_i\ + \\ &\beta_4*Gamma_i*M_i\ + \beta_5*HZE_i*M_i\ +\ [v_{j} + \epsilon_{ij}] \\
&i = 1, ..., 1169\ \mbox{ mice} \\
&j = 1,...,47\ \ \mbox{ families}
\end{aligned}$$

???
Our final model contains two main fixed effects for Treatment and Sex, and interaction terms for the levels of each factor. The model also contains a random intercept for Family. We selected this model using Aikike's Information Criterion (AIC), by comparing to mixed models with just Treatment, Treatment and Sex as additive effects, and all covariates included as additive effects, as well as a fixed model counterpart to this final model.
--
with non-informative priors:  

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_0 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_1 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_2 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_3 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_4 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_5 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
v_j &\sim N(0, \tau)\\
\tau &\sim Gamma(0.001, 0.001) \mbox{ where}\ \sigma^2 = 1/\tau\\
\end{aligned}$$

???
We also fit a complementary Bayesian model with the same parameterization, using non-informative priors for the fixed effects and the variance of the random effect. This enabled us to obtain a posterior distribution for the random effect, as well as easily interpretable credible intervals for the all model parameters.

This plot shows the probability of developing cataracts for each of the fixed effects in our final model. Differences between both sex and treatment group are clearly visible, and notably the differences betweeen treatment group across gender. 

Interpretation: females in general face less probability of developing cataracts than males, regardless of treatment group. We could argue that the effect of treatment group is not of clinical significance for female mice in this dataset. In contrast, males see a higher probability of developing cataracts than females across all treatment groups, but within male mice the difference between treatment group has clinical importance.

This plot visualizes the estimated probability of developing cataracts for each family in the dataset, along with their confidence intervals. The vertical lines plot the GLMM estimated variance and the MCMC mode for sigma^2. 

Interpretation: many of the probabilities shown are close to 0.5, with a smaller number (top 3, or maybe top 6) of families at the top of the graph that indicate some genetic clustering. Is that a large enough proportion of the families in the dataset to indicate clinical importance of genetic clustering?

## Conclusions

 + Female mice are less likely to develop cataracts than male mice across all treatment groups. Treatment is strongly associated with differences in the probability of male mice developing cataracts, but it is not strongly associated with differences in the probability of female mice developing cataracts.  
  
--
  
 + GLMM model selection and Bayesian HPD intervals indicate that Family is an important source of variation in predicting cataract development.  
  
--
  
 + The presence of competing risks in the experimental design complicate inferences about cataract development.   
 
???
Both HZE and Gamma radiation have severe side effects that may result in death before cataracts have time to develop.  
--
  
 + Further study is warranted to better understand these questions and their implications to humans undertaking space flight.
