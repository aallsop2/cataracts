Thanks for joining and listening to us talk about cataracts in mice! We are discussing our analysis  of Dr Weil's and Dr. Edmondson's research into the effects of high atomic energy (HZE) radiation. This work is important because there is very little precedent into studying this topic, and it has direct applications to space travel beyond the protection from HZE ions inside Earth's magnetic field.

## Introduction
  
 - Research Questions:  
    + Are mice in some families more likely to develop more severe cataracts?
    + Accounting for family clustering, are there differences in cataract development between treatment groups?  
  
???
This particular analysis focuses on potential genetic susceptibilty to developing cataracts. The mice used in this experiment were bred to be biologically heterogeneous, so any genetic predispositions may be easier to assess. Accounting for genetic effects also allows better examination of the effects of treatment on the outcome. Our goal was to determine if there was a genetic component to cataract development among mice that are exposed to radiation. 
  
--

 - Experimental Design:  
    + 1820 genetically heterogeneous mice from 48 unique families were randomly assigned, with equal family weights, to the three treatment groups. 
    + Mice in the active treatment groups were irradiated at 7-12 weeks of age; all mice were monitored weekly. 
    + Simplified dataset: symptoms at time of death for mice of Age $\ge$ 552 days, for a total sample size of 1169 mice from 47 families. 

???
To study the family effect, there were 48 biologically unique families and within those families the mice were assigned to receive one of the three treatments. At time of death for the mice that lived to at least 552 days, the severity of their cataracts were measured along with the other predictor variable measurements. There were 1169 mice total included.

--
  
 - Variable Definitions:  
    + **Response**: Cataract status, either 0 or 1 indicating the presence of cataracts of clinical concern.  
    + **Primary Predictors**: Treatment, Family  
    + **Possible Covariates**: Sex, Weight, Coat Color, Body Condition Score, Age, Myeloid Leukemia, Harderian Tumor, PreT Lymphoma  
  
???
The outcome in question is a binary response variable indicating presence or absence of cataracts. The treatment consists of three groups: Gamma irradiation, HZE irradiation, and Unirradiated Control. Biological Family indicates the random genetic effect. The dataset also contained information on potentially important covariates.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
???
The experimental design led us to conclude that we would include both Treatment and Family in a final model; consequently, our exploratory data analysis focused on associations between these variables and the response, other covariates and the response, and potential correlations and interactions between the main predictors, covariates, and the response. The barplot on the left shows sample proportions with cataracts for groups split by Treatment and Sex. The differences between sexes indicated to us that this covariate may be of interest in our final model. We also performed an exploratory assessment of the random effect of family; the line plot shows averaged binary Cataract score for each family across sex and treatment group. This visualizes the different behaviors in different families, but presence of clustering is not obvious.

## Final Model
$Y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p)$  

$$\begin{aligned}
log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = &\ \beta_0\ +\beta_1*Gamma_i\ + \beta_2*HZE_i\ + \beta_3*M_i\ + \\ &\beta_4*Gamma_i*M_i\ + \beta_5*HZE_i*M_i\ +\ [v_{j} + \epsilon_{ij}] \\
&i = 1, ..., 1169\ \mbox{ mice} \\
&j = 1,...,47\ \ \mbox{ families}
\end{aligned}$$

???
Our final model contains two main fixed effects for Treatment and Sex, and an interaction term for sex by treatment. The model also contains a random intercept for Family. We selected this model using Aikike's Information Criterion (AIC), by comparing it to several other models. These included:
a full mixed model including all the predictors included in the data set,
a mixed model with just treatment and sex and no interaction,
and a comprable fixed model to our final model with just sex and treatment.

--

with non-informative priors:  

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_0 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_1 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_2 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_3 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_4 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
\beta_5 &\sim N(0, 0.001)\\
v_j &\sim N(0, \sigma^2)\\
\tau &\sim Gamma(0.001, 0.001) \mbox{ where}\ \tau = 1/\sigma^2\\
\end{aligned}$$

???
We also fit a complementary Bayesian model with the same parameterization, using non-informative priors for the fixed effects and the variance of the random effect. This enabled us to obtain posterior distributions and easily interpretable credible intervalsf or both fixed and random effects.

This plot shows the probability of developing cataracts for each combination of sex by treatment group in our final model. Differences between both sex and treatment group are clearly visible, and notably the differences between treatment group across gender. 

Interpretation: females in general face less probability of developing cataracts than males, across all treatment groups. We could argue that the effect of treatment group is not of clinical significance for female mice in this dataset. As you can see, the probability of developing cataracts is quite low for all 3 treatment groups. Males, on the other hand, have a higher probability of developing cataracts than females across all treatment groups. For males, the differences of development of cataracts across treatment groups is of clinical importance.

This plot visualizes the estimated probability of developing cataracts for each family in the dataset, along with their confidence intervals. The vertical lines plot the GLMM estimated variance and the MCMC mode, and 95% credible interval for sigma^2. 

Interpretation: we see a wide range of probabilities around 0.5, with a smaller number (top 3, or maybe top 6) seemingly unlucky families indicating a genetic predisposition to developing cataracts. Notably, the Bayesian credible interval does not contain 0.5, evidence that genetic variation in incidence of cataracts is not completely random.

## Conclusions

 + Female mice are less likely to develop cataracts than male mice across all treatment groups. Treatment is strongly associated with differences in the probability of male mice developing cataracts, but it is not strongly associated with differences in the probability of female mice developing cataracts.  

???
Female mice have a lower probability of developing cataracts than male mice across all 3 treatment groups. The difference in probability of developing cataracts for females is very small and doesn't show a strong association. However, the differences in probability of developing cataracts among males in the three treatment groups are quite large and do indicate a strong association.
--
  
 + GLMM model selection and Bayesian HPD intervals indicate that Family is an important source of variation in predicting cataract development.  
  
--
  
 + The presence of competing risks in the experimental design complicate inferences about cataract development.   
 
???
Both HZE and Gamma radiation have severe side effects that may result in death before cataracts have time to develop.  
--
  
 + Further study is warranted to better understand these questions and their implications for humans undertaking space flight.
